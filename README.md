## General Notes:
- Kepp the indicator open when turning right or left on long lanes
- Go always to the right lane because you're a driving school
- If you don't have priority: Look Left, Then right, Then left again, then right and move.
- Wait for people.
- If there are cars in front of you and you're moving to the left. Wait until they all go or go when you have the green light.
- Pass the cycle if there's space and no one before you.
- Inside city conditional 30 will most of times be from 7h to 17h
- Outside city conditional 30 will be most of times be from 22h to 6h so speed will be 50
- Stay on the right side always
- Go to the viewing point **straight** if right then look before moving
- The handler should be over the sidewalk completely when parking between 2 cars
- Look straight when parking to know if you're straight
- Stop before auuto bahn exit on the traffic light not on the turning point
- In priority road/fast road expect that all are priority
